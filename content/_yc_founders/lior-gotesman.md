Founded in 2016 and based in Cupertino, California, <a href="https://relationshiphero.com/" target="_blank">Relationship Hero</a> has helped thousands of satisfied clients with their relationship issues - making them the #1 service for instant, affordable and professional relationship coaching. When you’re struggling with a relationship issue, such as a bad breakup, you need credible, actionable coaching and you need it now. You could turn to friends and family members for advice, but you may want to keep the issue private, or get an objective perspective from someone outside your situation. With Relationship Hero, you get instantly connected to a knowledgeable relationship coach in a private 1:1 chatroom or over the phone, and immediately get the help you need.

<b>What kind of challenges have you faced while building Relationship Hero & how did you overcome them?</b>

Most of the challenges I faced involved making Relationship Hero a service that people want, value and enjoy using. This service hasn’t existed before and there aren’t many similar ones like it. When I first started building our team of coaches, developing our training program, and designing the user experience, I’ve often relied on my intuition. But intuition alone wasn’t enough. By talking to clients, making data-driven decisions, running experiments, and quickly dropping what doesn’t work, I was able to bridge the gap between what I thought worked and what actually worked.
