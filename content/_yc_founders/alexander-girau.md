<a href="http://www.advanotech.com/" target="_blank">Advano</a> combines nanotechnology with fundamental chemical engineering principles to accelerate the renewable energy revolution. Advano's silicon nanoparticles dramatically increase the energy density lithium-ion batteries 30-40% without sacrificing battery life or increasing the battery cost. Better batteries for ioT, consumer electronics, and EVs.

<b>What kind of challenges have you faced while building Advano & how did you overcome them?</b>

The biggest challenge is stress management. I've learned to manage it by going to Founder meetups, finding things to be thankful for, loving the process and realizing that this is the dream of so many and it should be taken with gratitude and care.

<b>Alexander's Notes on his recommendations:</b>

<i>Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor E. Frankl</i>

It gives a look into the struggle of an individual in an extreme situation: how to think about morality, keep sanity and perspective in the most challenging time, and how to find purpose in even the most dire circumstances.

<i>Hacker News</i>
    
It helps one to stay educated and literate on a host of disparate topics from those that you have something to contribute to those that you never think of. It is also a place where founders post personal stories of success, or even failures like "How My Start-up Died, and What Did I Learn from It?"

<i>The Great CEO Within by Matt Mochary</i>

(Formerly: Founder to CEO) This is a book about how to build a category-killing company from the ground up. It's an AWESOME guide on how to go from Founder to CEO, a transition many find incredibly hard to make. Unfortunately, it is only a Google doc, but is shared around the start-up community if you look hard enough.
