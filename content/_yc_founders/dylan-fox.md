<a href="https://www.assemblyai.com/">AssemblyAI</a> is a startup building a speech-to-text API that will help developers build customized chat interfaces quickly. They use the latest deep learning technology to build practical products that bring futuristic ideas to life. At AssemblyAI, they believe that cutting edge artificial intelligence technology should not be limited to only those with the funding or resources to invest in it. Their goal is to help make creative, new ideas possible by making AI technology accessible to everyone through easy to use products, whether you are an independent developer, startup, or global company.

<b>What's the best and/or worst piece of advice you've received while building AssemblyAI?</b>

Best advice -- focus on metrics! This seems obvious but is often easy to overlook when you're moving so fast in a startup. What metrics are you going to hold yourself and your startup accountable to? For us (we are building a Speech to Text API), we track our accuracy and processing latency metrics very closely.

<b>Dylan's Notes on his books:</b>

Not all of them are directly related to startups, but I think that's good. It's good to step out of the startup bubble and get some fresh air every now and then.
