Jen Rubio is the Co-Founder, President, and Chief Branding Officer of Away, a direct-to-consumer smart luggage startup. As a world-class traveller, Jen was struck by the idea for Away when her luggage broke and she had to shop for a new one at Zurich Airport. She was shocked by the fact that <a href="https://bondstreet.com/jen-rubio-interview/ ">“you could buy a $500 or a $40 bag and they’d be sold next to each other with no discernible difference”.</a> Jen definitely found the perfect gap in the market as Away has rapidly grown and raised $108M in just a couple of years.

Jen is a branding mastermind in the fashion space. Before founding her current company, she worked as Head of Social Media at popular direct-to-consumer eyeglasses company, Warby Parker, and Global Head of Innovation at AllSaints.
