Justin Hein is the CEO and Co-Founder of Rose Rocket, a venture-backed Y Combinator (Summer 2016) alumnus company. Rose Rocket is an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) software used by trucking companies to manage critical steps in their ordering process. It works in a multi-billion dollar industry that we don’t really think about but YC partners do: 

“Trucking is one of the largest industries in the US and it is one of the last large industries not to be disrupted by technology. Do you know the app that Uber drivers use? Amazingly, truck drivers still don’t have anything like that – in some cases, they still communicate with their base over the radio. Rose Rocket is the right solution. It’s modern software that makes trucking companies better without trying to replace them. Even when trucks become driverless, trucking companies will still need to manage their operations, and they will use Rose Rocket to do it.” – Jared Friedman, Partner, Y Combinator
