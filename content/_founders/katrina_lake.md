Katrina Lake is the Founder and CEO of Stitch Fix, an online subscription and personal styling service. You may have seen the iconic photo of her at Nasdaq MarketSite taking her company public with her then 14-month-old son at her hip. 

Katrina is the youngest female founder to take a company public, and she herself never saw it coming. In an interview with Elle Magazine she joked she was always the <a href="https://www.elle.com/fashion/a15895336/katrina-lake-stitch-fix-ceo-interview/">“master of the A-minus. I’m not somebody that people looked at and said, ‘Oh, she’s going to be a CEO someday.’”</a>

But Katrina has earned that title with all of the hurdles she has jumped through. Having always had a passion for the intersection of fashion and tech, Katrina started Stitch Fix as a school project while attending Harvard Business School. She has had to deal with professors calling her idea an “inventory nightmare” to convincing mostly male Venture Capitalists to fund an idea they just couldn’t wrap their heads around. WIth all of her triumphs, Katrina Lake is now a powerful name giving strength to female founders everywhere.
