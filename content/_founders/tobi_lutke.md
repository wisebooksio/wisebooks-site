Tobi Lutke is the founder and sitting CEO of Shopify, a Canadian e-Commerce software-as-a-service unicorn startup. Tobi was born in Germany, dropped out of school to join the Kblenzer Carl-Benz-school apprenticeship to become a computer programmer after the tenth grade. 

He then moved to Canada and started a company called Snowdevil, an online snowboard shop. The lack of e-commerce platforms available that made it easy for merchants to create online stores is what prompted Tobi and his co-founders to create Shopify which now helps over 300,000 merchants to conduct over $20 billion dollars of gross merchandise sales (as of 2006).

In 2014, he was listed as The Globe and Mailâ€™s CEO of the year and he is also an advocate for digital literacy in Canada and sits on the board of Canada Learning Code!
