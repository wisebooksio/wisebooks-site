Richard Thaler has received a Nobel Prize for his behavioural economics contributions, so you know he’s the real deal. His studies mainly focus on the intersection of behavioural economics and finance. He’s argued that in an economic context, people are not rational beings and make emotional, human decisions. He has also explored the concept of mental accounting which on a very basic level, can be described as people treating money differently based on its intended use and origin. For example, people want to save $1 on groceries rather than saving $1 on a new TV because the $1 seems like more value saved on a smaller amount like groceries, although they’re the same $1. This idea led to the development of the behavioural finance field.

Thaler is also the co-author of global best seller, <i><a href="https://amzn.to/2rr9f0q">Nudge</a></i> and has published <i><a href="https://amzn.to/2PuQIde">Misbehaving: The Making of Behavioral Economics</a></i>.
