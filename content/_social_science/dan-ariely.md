Dan Ariely is a Professor of Psychology and Behavioral Economics at Duke University and is the founder of The Center for Advanced Hindsight and co-founder of Kayma BEworks, Timeful, Genie and Shapa. His life’s mission is to translate behavioural economics into plain language to use in daily life, which has led him to author several books, <i><a href="https://amzn.to/2Uz6uYc">Irrationally Yours</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/2SCMMsE">Predictably Irrational</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/2EalK8d">The Upside of Irrationality</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/2EoRN5d">The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty</a></i>, a movie, <i>Dishonesty</i>, and a card game, <i>Irrational Game</i>. 

Ariely was inspired to dive into this field when he was hospitalized due to an explosion and receiving treatments for his burns. His treatments were always incredibly painful, partly due to the irrational behaviours and ways they were delivered by the healthcare professionals. When he left the hospital, he began his research into how to provide better care for injured patients. In his words, <a href="http://danariely.com/all-about-dan/">“I became engrossed with the idea that we repeatedly and predictably make the wrong decisions in many aspects of our lives and that research could help change some of these patterns.”</a>
