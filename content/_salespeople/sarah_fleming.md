(Hey guys, Christine from Wisebooks here) Speaking personally, Sarah is every aspect of the best sales manager a person could ask for. She listens, she follows through, and she <i>genuinely</i> cares. 

Sarah was responsible for building up the sales team from a tiny group of people to the behemoth that it is today. At one point, she was balancing all of those people on her own while working on and thinking about the strategic expansion of the business across the country. To say sheâ€™s superwoman would be an understatement.
