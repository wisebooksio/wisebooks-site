Kara Swisher is an American technology business journalist and co-founder of <a href="https://www.recode.net/">Recode</a> which is a technology news site that focuses on the business of Silicon Valley. She has written two books about AOL, runs several podcasts (like the popular Recode Decode) and contributes to the tech section of the New York Times Opinion section.

Swisher has been touted as “iconic” by the creator of the hit TV show, <i>Silicon Valley</i>, and apparently <a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2014/07/kara-swisher-silicon-valleys-most-powerful-snoop.html">“layers charm and aggression to truth-serum affect”.</a>  

This boss-a** lady started reporting about tech in the early ‘90s and was already a veteran in the industry when the Web 2.0 generation was coming of age. She’s reported on some of the biggest news in tech such as <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20080304/sheryl-sandberg-will-become-coo-of-facebook/">Facebook Hiring Sheryl Sandberg</a> and <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20101129/googles-groupon-offer-5-3-billion-with-700-million-earnout/">Google Trying to Buy Groupon</a>(like damn girl, what an exciting time in tech). She met Jeff Bezos when Amazon was still a startup and Marc Andreessen when Netscape was about to IPO (Netscape is what brought us the World Wide Web so yeah, that’s a BIG deal).

Swisher is known to be very vocal about the underrepresentation of women at big tech companies #YAAASSS, scrutinizing Marissa Mayer and Yahoo, and unearthing the ethical issues surrounding TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington’s journalism. She is the Valley’s most loved and most feared journalist.
