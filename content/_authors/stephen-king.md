Stephen King is the guy that writes the books that get made into movies that make you scared of washrooms and the dark (a.k.a he writes freaky AF horror novels). More specifically, they say his genre is in horror, fantasy, drama, crime suspense, thriller, and other words along those lines. 

His books have collectively sold more than 350 million copies and have been adapted into several feature films and television shows. And if it doesn’t fit into TV or film, someone finds a way to make it a mini-series (think <i>Carrie, The Shining, IT,</i> etc.) 

After his graduation he was actually pursuing teaching among a number of other part-time jobs while writing in all of his free time. Two years later, the King of Horror sold his first novel, <i>Carrie</i>. If you haven’t seen it… don’t…. Unless you like cr*pping your pants. Its insane success allowed him to quit everything else and focus on full-time writing, and he starting pumping out book after book after book. He had so many ideas and even started publishing under pseudonyms out of concern that the public wouldn’t accept multiple books from the same author in one year.
