Susan Cain is the author of Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Can’t Stop Talking which argues that introverted people are undervalued in Western culture. Her TED talk on <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/susan_cain_the_power_of_introverts">“The Power of Introverts”</a> has more than 20M views and she’s the Co-Founder of Quiet Revolution which is all about empowering introverts.

And surprise, surprise! Cain is an introvert herself. On the <a href="https://www.quietrev.com/author/susan-cain/">Quiet Revolution site</a> she says,“I prefer listening to talking, reading to socializing, and cozy chats to group settings. I like to think before I speak (softly). Until a few years ago, I was terrified of public speaking, and I am still amazed that such a giant fear is conquerable.”

Cain has an impressive curriculum vitae, one that might make you think, “Is this really that introvert lady?”. She is an ex-corporate lawyer, having represented clients like Goldman Sachs and General Electric. She has also worked as a negotiations consultant, having trained all kinds of people from hedge fund managers to TV producers. She’s the perfect example of how your nature shouldn’t limit you in any way and how people shouldn’t be pigeonholed into labels. 

Cain’s favorite activities are reading, writing, lounging around cafés, and doing the mambo with my family. Speaking of reading, here are Susan Cain’s favorite books.
