Neil Gaiman has come up a lot on Wisebooks’ people lists (like <a href="https://www.wisebooks.io/dara-khosrowshahi/">Dara Khosrowshahi</a>, CEO of Uber) which has some logic. They say a number of CEOs, founders, and makers are big fans of science fiction because it creates a habit of imagining things that don’t exist. What do you do as a founder or someone of the like? Create things that don’t exist. Maybe we should all be reading a little more Sci-Fi like some of Gaiman’s famous works: <i>The Sandman, Neverwhere, American Gods, Stardust, Coraline ,The Graveyard Book, Good Omens, and The Ocean at the End of the Lane</i>.

Gaiman started his writing career with a number of different works such as publishing biographies of Duran Duran (if you haven’t heard of them, same; they’re a British Band) and Douglas Adams, the author of the very famous <i>Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</i>. He moved onto comics and collaborations with Dave McKean, which led to their works being published by DC Comics. 

His (as of right now) magnum opus is <i>Sandman</i> with 75 issues out (BTW it’s a comic book), and the first comic to ever receive a literary award at the 1991 World Fantasy Awards.
