Justin Trudeau is Canada's super hot, liberal Prime Minister with a hella cute family. He's honestly a pretty nice guy. He promotes pretty much all the social causes like winter-sport safety, fights back against construction that affects communities like the $100M zinc mine that would have poisoned the Nahanni River, he was MC at a rally that called for the Canadian participation in the Darfur crisis in Sudan, he proudly declares that he's a feminist, led the country's legalisation in marijuana, supports LGBTQ communities and legislation, etc.
 
Justin Trudeau is the eldest son of Pierre-Elliot Trudeau who was the Prime Minister that brought positive immigration policy to Canada, which has now become part of the country's national identity.
 
Trudeau was elected on April 14, 2013. Prior, he had been working as a French and Social Science teacher at schools in Vancouver, British Columbia. He was also an actor once in a TV miniseries.
