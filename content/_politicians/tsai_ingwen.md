Tsai Ing-wen is the current President of Taiwan (officially the Republic of China), in office since May 2016. As chair of the Democratic Progressive Party (DDP), she won the majority vote by 56%, trumping her greatest opponent Eric Chu of the Kuomintang (KMT) or the Nationalist Party.

Her win is attributed to her successful reparation of DPP’s unfavourable image after the Chen Shui-bian presidency, which was marked with deteriorating ethnic relations, extreme corruption, and tense relations with mainland China and the United States. Tsai’s campaign focused on returning Taiwan to greater economic growth, increasing innovation, solidifying free-trade agreements, and breaking into regional economic organizations that controlled world trade.

Her presidency is historical in the sense that she is Taiwan’s first female president, the second person to win as a non-KMT member, and the first Hakka (one of Taiwan’s ethnic minorities) to attain this position.
