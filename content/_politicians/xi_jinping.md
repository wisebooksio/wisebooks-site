Chairman Xi Jinping is the leader of the Communist Party of China, President of the People's Republic of China, and the Chairman of the Central Military Commission. He is often referred to as China's 'paramount leader'.
 
He is the son of Xi Zhongxun who was also a politician in his day, working as a part of the country's first generation of leadership making numerous important contributions, such as the economic liberalization in the south in the 1980s, and was known for his political moderation. However, he endured a number of setbacks in his career.
 
He was imprisoned and purged too many times in his career and during the Cultural Revolution. As a result his son, Xi Jinping was exiled to rural Yanchuan county where he lived in a cave in the Liangjiahe village where he organized communal labourers.
 
Once he left, he attended Tsinghua University, the second best school in the country. He was a part of the "Worker-Peasant-Soldier-Student" class, in which underprivileged individuals were given preference in the education system from 1970 to 1976. During this time, students were given preference based on the class background of their parents so children of workers, peasants, and soldiers enjoyed special privileges during the Cultural Revolution. Or in Xi's case, he no longer had a father and was a peasant.
 
After school, he began his long political career and rose through the ranks until today, where he is the Chairman of China's Communist Party. Since he took office, he has introduced a far-reaching number of measures to enforce party power in the country and on the world stage, and maintain nationalist unity among his people.
 
President Xi has a pretty strong hold on the structure of the political system, the people of the country, and he's going to be around for a long time especially since he eliminated the two-term limit in the country's constitution.
 
In 2018, Forbes called him the most powerful and influential person in the world, dethroning the 5-year chair held by Vladimir Putin.
