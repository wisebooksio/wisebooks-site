Vladimir (Vladimirovich) Putin is the current president of Russia (and has been since 2000). Today he is the face of Russia and one of the most powerful men in the world.
 
He was originally born in Leningrad during the Soviet Union, this was also where he studied law until 1975 when he graduated. Following his studies, naturally, he was working for the government as a KGB foreign intelligence officer for 16 years.
 
<b>What is the KGB?</b>

So it stands for Komitet gosudarstvennoy bezopasnosti which translates as the Committee for State Security. They were the main security agency in the Soviet Union from 1954 until its collapse in 1991. It was the internal security agency, intelligence agency, and the country's secret police. 
 
There were a number of similar agencies that held these same responsibilities in each of the Soviet Union republics during the time of its existence. Since the Soviet Union doesn't exist anymore, the KGB has been renamed as the Federal Security Service and the Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation.
 
January 1, 2000, Putin was elected from the previous regime. He crushed it and was in the perfect environment to do so. During his first term from 2000-2008, the economy grew quite substantially for eight years straight. GDP grew 72% measured through the country's purchasing power.
 
This was largely due to the 2000s commodities boom which could be accredited to the increase in demand from emerging BRIC markets (Brazil, Russia, India, China). Particularly, China saw a massive influx in demand during this time as the country was "opening up" with more foreign policy that supported import/export trade.
 
Other factors that contributed were the post-Communist depression recovery (i.e. It's a lot easier to grow a small country than an already large, developed one). Coupled with prudent economic and fiscal policies, he was pretty good but as you may have noticed in the news, he's not the best. However, he still remains in power.
 
<b>Why?</b>

He jails his rivals... Among other things.
 
The country struggles in transparency, corruption, equal economic opportunity, etc. He was pulling it off for quite a while with insanely high approval ratings, once even ranked as the world's most popular politicians with approval ratings as high as 89%.
 
People are accrediting the rating to the improvements in living standards and the reassertion of Russia on the world stage. However, they're quickly falling and if Putin doesn't make some changes... Let's be real, he'll probably still be in power.
 
These are some of the thinkers and books that have strongly influenced him along the way. However, please note this comment in a Russian interview “It’s impossible to answer questions like favourite book or favourite performance or favourite music because there are so many favourites”. 

“What are the elements of talent? Not one, two or three genes, but a combination of everything”.
