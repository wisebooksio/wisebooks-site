Hillary Rodham Clinton is most recently remembered as the Democrat candidate in the past US elections, but she has served as Secretary of State, Senator from New York, and First Lady of the United States. Fun fact: her book, <i>It Takes a Village and Other Lessons Children Teach Us</i>, was a best seller and she received a Grammy Award for her recording of it.

Way before her political career, Clinton enrolled in Yale Law School, where she was one of just 27 women in her graduating class. While attending Yale, Hillary began dating one of her classmates, Bill Clinton.

After graduation, Hillary advised the Children’s Defense Fund in Cambridge and joined the impeachment inquiry staff advising the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives. After a while, she “followed her heart to Arkansas,” where her husband had begun his political career. She advocated for public health issues such as expanding health insurance coverage and ensuring children are properly immunized. She also wrote a weekly newspaper column entitled “Talking It Over,” which focused on her experiences as First Lady and her observations of women, children, and families she has met around the world. 

She was the first First Lady elected to the United States Senate and the first woman elected statewide in New York. Clinton has been publicly scrutinized for some of her controversial activities however, she has also won many admirers for her strong support for women around the world and her commitment to children’s issues.
