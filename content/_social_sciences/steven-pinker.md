Pinker is a Canadian-American cognitive psychologist and writer on popular science (think human behaviour, language, human nature, mind, etc.) He majored in Psychology at McGill University in Montreal before earning his PhD from Harvard in Experimental Psychology in 1979 where he taught as a professor. He moved to MIT, then Stanford, for a short period and returned to Harvard to teach in 2003. His books include <i>The Language Instinct, How the Mind Works, The Blank Slate, The Better Angels of our Nature, The Sense of Style</i>, etc. etc. etc…. (10 books in total) So he has a lot of books but he has also been a frequent contributor for the New York Times, Time magazine, The Atlantic, and other notable publications. 

His early studies revolved around understanding how humans understand languages, focussing on individuals’ innate abilities to understand languages leading to a conclusion that this arose from evolutionary adaptation. This led to his first popular book, listed on <a href="https://www.wisebooks.io/entrepreneur/2018/08/02/bill-gates.html">Bill Gates’ list</a>, <i><a href="https://amzn.to/2PwIFfZ">The Language Instinct: How the Mind Creates Language</a></i>. Its sequel, <i><a href="https://amzn.to/2EeFffW">How the Mind Works</a></i> won the Pulitzer Prize for general nonfiction writing.

Hi books aimed at general audiences have truly made him one of the best-known intellectuals in the world.
