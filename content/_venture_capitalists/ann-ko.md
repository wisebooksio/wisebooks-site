Ann Miura-Ko is one of the early investors of Lyft, TaskRabbit, Refinery29, and companies in machine intelligence like Ayasdi and Xamarin which were quickly acquired by Microsoft (and just to number drop… for a speculated \$400 mill). And to top it off, she backs women hard, as a founding member of <i>All Raise</i>, the venture fund that is trying to get more female funders and female founders into the startup space that has too-long been dominated by men. These achievements put her on the Midas list, which is Forbes’ definitive list of the top 100 venture capitalists that year in high-tech and life sciences (how? <a href="http://fortune.com/2011/04/06/nitpicking-the-forbes-midas-list/">Here</a>).
