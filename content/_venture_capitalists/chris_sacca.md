Chris is an early-stage investor and has success stories by being one of the first few investors in companies like Twitter, Instagram, Uber, Gimlet, Kickstarter, and the list goes on. He owns what will likely be the most successful VC fund in history. His fund is called LOWERCASE Capital.

Chris has many books and resources to recommend that have helped him become a better investor but not all of them are business books. He didn’t get a business degree, no MBA, no law degree, no formal business training. He’s looked at “a few of those Instant MBA books, and stuff like that, I even bought some books on venture capital, and they’re just...so goofy. And by the way, part of that is because we now have so many great venture capitalist bloggers who are just an open book about the industry, who teach it”.
