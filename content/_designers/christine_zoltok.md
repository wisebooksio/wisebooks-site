<b>Christine on her reading habits</b>

My reading habits have shifted over the years, but these days with young children at home I mostly read while commuting. It's about 20 minutes in the morning and evening, and keeping a book in my purse means I spend less time on my phone. If I'm particularly captivated by a book I'll keep reading it in the evening, but those moments during the commute ensure I don't lose momentum. I read mostly non-fiction these days but I love a good fiction book if I get a great recommendation.

There have been tons of books that have influenced me throughout my career at different stages, but here are a few that were very influential for me.
