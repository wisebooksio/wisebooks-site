Alex Jin is a product manager at Dropbox in San Francisco. He works with the growth team who frequently run experiments and drive cross-team initiatives. He helps his team make product decisions that directly impact revenue and address business problems. This differs from traditional product management which focuses primarily on the core product and is use/feature-driven.

<b>Reading Habits</b>

I listen to audiobooks/podcasts during my commute, workout or while running an errand. For physical books, Iâ€™ll do some reading before bed.
