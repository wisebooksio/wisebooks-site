<b>Reading Habits</b>

I tend to read books in two primary ways: on my kindle or as an audiobook while driving. I almost always listen to audiobooks on commutes, preferring a good book to listening to music or podcasts, though cycle through both those choices quite often. For reading, I tend to read a bunch late at night, or sometimes during the day when I can get an hour or two to myself. I go back and reread books quite often, especially ones that I truly enjoyed or felt that there was a lesson there that I missed that might be worth revisiting.

<b>Rushabh's Notes on his Books:</b>

It is hard to pin down a book or a set of books that have been the most useful. I read a variety of books, ranging from history, biographies, business and strategy, management - all the way to tons of science fiction and fantasy. All these books help in different ways - helping me think about things past, present and future. If I had to pick one book in each category, I'd probably pick the following:

* History: <i>The Making Of The Atomic Bomb</i> by Richard Rhodes 
* Business: <i>Good Strategy/Bad Strategy: The Difference and Why it Matters</i> by Richard Rumelt
* Management: <i>High Output Management</i> by Andrew S. Grove
* Sci-Fi: <i>A Deepness In The Sky</i> by Vernor Vinge
