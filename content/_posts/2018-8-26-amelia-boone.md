She has collected four obstacle racing championship titles and stood on over 50 podiums in five years, while ALSO working as a full-time corporate attorney at Apple Inc. Amelia Boone is an inspiration with unparalleled grit and grace, often dubbed as the Queen of Pain and the Michael Jordan of Obstacle Course racing. 

<b>WHAT.</b>

She was the 2013 Spartan Race world champion, three-time champion of the World’s Toughest Mudder (2012, 2014,2015), Spartan race Points Series Champion (2013, 2015), three-time Death Race Finisher (2012 Winter & Summer, 2013 Summer). All of the listed are basically the most intense obstacle races you could ever dream of and these are only some of the highlights of her incredibly impressive obstacle race, ultrarunning career. 

However, in April 2016, Boone fractured her femur as a result of putting too much stress on the biggest, strongest bone in her body. Her training put her through so much pain to begin with, and she continued to train, despite the fracture, with workouts that would avoid stressing that part of her body such as swimming, biking with just one leg, and using her crutches as a form of exercise. After speaking to doctors and trainers, and injuring her other leg, she was sentenced to a full year of probation from exercise. She had to stop, she had to let her body rest, and with that, Boone had to let go of fitness which at the time, felt like letting go of her identity.  

Before the injury, Boone’s mindset was destructive, feeling that she had to prove herself, she felt that she had to show results, people were depending on her, they wanted her to succeed and that they would only like her if she was standing on top of podiums. Winning gave her temporary highs that would never last, and once she couldn’t win anymore, she had to step back, redefine her relationship with herself, and with the sport of running. 

In some ways, she is grateful for the injury. Now, she runs and trains for the love and the sake of running, viewing the race as a celebration of all the training that one has put in. At the end of the day, she would run regardless of everything else. She is driven by the process, no longer by the outcome and with that, she experiences joy and peace with every mile she moves; a lesson we can all take from Amelia Boone.
