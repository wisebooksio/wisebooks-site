Yuval Noah Harari is an Israeli professor of history at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, receiving his PhD from Oxford in 2002. However, his acquired fame is a result of his best-selling novels, Homosapiens and Homodeus, of which you will find on the favourite book lists of many on this site. 

Sapiens was rejected by four publishers before the fifth decide to give the author a chance. The book reviews the history of humankind and provides a thesis of why humans have risen so quickly, to the top of the food chain while Homodeus, speculates the future. 

Looking to answer the big questions of history, he questions our past, and our future. What will become of Homosapiens?

Sapiens has since been translated into 50 different languages, topping international best sellers lists and is enthusiastically, and widely praised. Both Sapiens and Homodeus have collectively sold over 12 million copies around the world. Harariâ€™s third book is expected to come out this August 30, 2018: 21 Questions for the 21st Century. 

Harari was born in Israel in 1976 to a secular Jewish family with Lebanese and East European roots. He married his husband in Toronto, Canada and tries to be as much of a vegan as he can as a result of his research in the domestication of farm animals.
