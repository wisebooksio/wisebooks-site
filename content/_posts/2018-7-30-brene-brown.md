Dr. Brown is a research professor at the University of Houston who has spent the last 16 years of her life studying courage, vulnerability, shame, and empathy. She has used this research to write four #1 NY Times best sellers. Her TED Talk, the Power of Vulnerability, is one of the top 5 viewed talks boasting over 30M views. She is now somewhat of a celebrity professor commonly coined “the vulnerability woman”, the “shame academic”, the “self-help queen”, and she resents it. 

She’s successful but she wants the focus to be on the work, not on her cult of celebrity. Despite her feelings towards her fame, Brown has been able to reach crowds and masses of people that most researchers can only dream of. 

Dr. Brown’s work was a result of the interviews she conducted in which she found a common theme: that connection is the key to everything but there is a fear that prevents us from reaching it. However, there was a class of people who were not afraid to be vulnerable, those who were not constantly worried about rejection or shame.
