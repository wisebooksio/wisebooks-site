Dr. Jordan B. Peterson is a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto, a clinical psychologist and the author of bestseller <i>12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos</i>. His controversial right-wing opinions have been receiving a lot of publicity and he’s amassed a large online following due to his views. We won’t go into the deep end with his political arguments (we’re here to talk about books, people), but his life experiences in themselves are something to talk about.

Raised in Northern Alberta, Canada, he has flown stuntplanes, steered a racing sailboat around Alcatraz Island, and has been inducted into a Pacific Kwakwaka’wakw family. As an academic, he’s published more than a hundred scientific papers revolving around the modern understanding of creativity, competence and personality.

Whether you’re a fan of him or not, his eclectic reading list is something to take note of. Check out his most recommended books below:
