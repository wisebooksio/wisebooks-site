Muna Abusulayman is a Middle Eastern Queen, listed as the 21st Most Powerful Arab Woman in the world in 2011. 

She is a global businesswoman and activist, the former founding Secretary General of the Alwaleed Bin Talal Foundation (the philanthropic arm of the HRH Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal’s Kingdom Holding Company), and the Middle East’s leading media personality as the co-host of MBC TV’s most popular social programs. 

Some other jaw-dropping achievements: 
* 2004: Named Young Leader by the World Economic Forum and was thus called upon to discuss the challenges facing young people around the world
* 2007: Became the first woman from Saudi Arabia appointed as the Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Development Program
* 2009: One of the most influential Muslims in the world
* 2011: Being the champion for humanitarian causes like tetanus shots in 2011 for people in Yemen

Coming from an Arab background, Muna has received some criticism for being a woman who is so engaged and active in public life which makes her all the more admirable. She is a strong supporter of female empowerment especially in her home country, Saudi Arabia, who is not known for being particularly progressive. 

“When you change women's conditions and empower them, you change the whole family".
