Keegan-Michael Keele of the too-funny <i>Key & Peele</i> comedy show is not just wildly entertaining, but seriously important. Frequently adopting high-risk social topics into their skits such as slavery, police brutality, racial dynamics, and so much more, to make their audience laugh nervously and think a little. 

Check out one of their videos <a href="http://www.comedycentral.co.uk/key-and-peele/videos/auction-block-0">here</a>

"The deepest part of a scene should be from a human place first so that anyone can identify with the character's plight. I think it's effective to make everyone go, Oh, I didn't know black people could be like that! It sounds silly to say that, because you, in your mind, go, Some people don't understand other people's experience, so the experience is so alien to them that it's almost not human. You can make the humanness of it a touchstone, and hopefully it appeals to all people and it opens up dialogue amongst all people." - Key in <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/kelleylcarter/keegan-michael-key-is-the-comedian-we-need-right-now">Buzzfeed News</a>
