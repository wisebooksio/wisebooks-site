Kevin Rose is an investor and VC at True Ventures, the CEO and founder of Oak Meditation, has 14 exits under his belt, and is a podcaster at the Kevin Rose Show.

He’s got a pretty big list of things going on like co-founder of Digg, Revision3, among other startups here and there. The experience brought him to work at Google, before moving into Google Ventures as a general partner. There he was an early investor in companies like Ripple, Medium, and Next Door. 

Before that, he started his angel investing career as an early player with these big names: Twitter, Facebook, and square. 

He’s on lists like Bloomberg’s Top 25 Angel Investors, Forbes’ Top 25 Web Celebrities, TIME Magazine’s Top 25 Most Influential People on the Web,  MIT’s Top 35 Innovators under 35, Businessweek’s Most Influential People on the Web, and 5X Webby Award Winner.

He also has a free meditation app called Oak in the app store. 

What does he do now? Podcasting, raise a kid with his wife, and probably a host of other random things. 

Here are Kevin Rose's favorite books.
