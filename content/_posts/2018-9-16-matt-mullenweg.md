Matt Mullenweg is the co-founder of Wordpress, a website builder that powers sites like TIME, Forbes, Wall Street Journal, oh, also the other <a href="https://ma.tt/about/">31%+ of the sites on the internet</a>. Wordpress is owned by Automattic which is valued at over $1 billion… also founded by Mullenweg. 

Wordpress is 90% of his life but the extra capacity he has is directed towards his other company, Audrey Capital, where he advises a number of pretty <a href="https://audrey.co/">neat startups</a>. 

He’s made a lot of <a href="https://ma.tt/about/">important lists</a> having been named on PC World’s Top 50 People on the Web, Inc’s 30 under 30, and Business Week’s 25 Most Influential People on the Web, and also one of Tim Ferriss’s favorite people if you’ve ever listened to his podcasts (they’re great).

Mullenweg started out in sunny Houston, Texas then started a degree in political science before moving to San Francisco where he started working for CNET networks which is a pretty massive blog (they create content in the tech news and product review area).
