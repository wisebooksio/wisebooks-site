Coach George Raveling was a pioneer and innovator in American sports, living many lives as a college basketball player and coach, Fox News Sports and CBS broadcaster, and at the request of Phil Knight himself, joined Nike. He started out as Director of Grass Roots Basketball, Director of Global Marketing, and at 70 years old, promoted again to the international director of basketball at Nike (instrumental in signing the former Adidas-man, Michael Jordan). He’s in several Halls of Fame, has a lot of awards, but if you’re not into sports (like us), just know that he’s the big deal in basketball. 

He was the first African-American basketball coach at Villanova University, Washington State, University of Maryland, University of Iowa, and USC. He is revered among many and at 80, still has the energy and eagerness to learn as that of a college student. The man has a life full of stories that could keep you on the edge of your seat for at least a few days, including the legendary saga of how he came across the original copy of Martin Luther King Jr.’s "I have a dream" speech. Yes… brought on as a security guard by a friend’s father at the March on Washington for civil rights, King Jr. finished his speech, and on impulse, Coach asked for the speech.

His father died when Coach was nine and his mother was institutionalized when he was 13. His guide in life was his grandmother, with a driving force being his academics.

Coach’s hobbies are collecting books and friends. Since his friends are not as accessible as his books, here are a few of the ones that he’s been recommending lately among the (literal) thousands that he’s read over the years:
