Dr. Attia is a former ultra endurance athlete and a relentless self-experimenter. With a Bachelor of Science in mechanical engineering from Queen’s University and an M.D. from Stanford, he is Tim Ferriss’s (a popular author and podcaster) go-to doctor on all things performance or longevity-related. Attia worked as a surgeon, putting in years of study before switching into consultancy at McKinsey & Co. modelling credit risk. 

He has since returned to medicine as the founder of Attia Medical PC. Attia Medical is a practice that focuses on the applied science of longevity. It applies nutritional biochemistry, exercise physiology, sleep physiology, and other tactics to increase distress tolerance, pharmacology, and four system endocrinology. The outcome being an increased lifespan by delaying chronic diseases while improving health span by means of improvements in the quality of one’s life. 

“In my specific area of longevity, I hear too much emphasis on how people look (sort of important) and feel (important, to be sure), but very little on the actual task of delaying the onset of chronic disease, which is almost the mathematical equivalent of delaying death and improving the quality of life.”
