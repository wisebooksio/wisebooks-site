Herd moved to LA in early 2012, becoming an early co-founder of Tinder but left due to allegations of another founder’s acts of sexual harassment and discrimination towards her. Once she left, settled the suit for a reported $1M, she never wanted to work in the dating industry again. She had an idea for a supportive women’s social network called Merci. 

Andrey Andreev, the founder of the largest dating network in the world, Badoo, saw Herd’s departure from Tinder as an opportunity. They had been in contact after Tinder and Herd pitched Merci to him. He said he loved it, but he said she needed to do this in dating. She didn’t want to work in dating but he offered her funding and access to Badoo’s technical team to ship the product. This was an offer that had fallen into her lap; it was too good to pass up. 

After several meetings of idea-talk, Bumble was born. Four years later, the app boasts 30 million users and a valuation of $1 billion. Bumble is not just a dating app though, they have expanded into BumbleBIZZ for professional social networking, and Bumble BFF for those who just want to make new friends. 

Throughout the years they have built a community of Bumblers and commemorated that in the physical form of “hives” that are spaces, allowing dates to meet up, friends to hang out, and for events to be held with powerful speakers. 

Herd and her team want to “recalibrate gender norms and empowering people to connect globally”. Bumble is not just an app, it’s a movement.
