Bozoma Saint John or “Boz” has a contagiously positive personality. Listen to <a href="https://tim.blog/2017/12/27/bozoma-saint-john-2/">this interview</a> between her and Tim Ferriss - I dare you not to smile AT LEAST once. 

Right now she is the Chief Marketing Officer at Endeavor, the Beverly-Hills talent agency representing a number of very acclaimed film/TV stars. Prior to her current position she was Head of Global Consumer Marketing of Apple Music and iTunes, after joining the company through the acquisition of Beats. Buzzfeed called her the <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/jessicamisener/bozoma-st-john-is-the-coolest-person-to-go-onstage-at-an-app">“coolest”</a> person to ever speak as an Apple Keynote. 

For a short while, she was a local celebrity at Uber as its Chief Brand Officer but quickly left after one year to pursue her current opportunity in managing Endeavor's marketing and brand efforts. Seeing this as an opportunity to make an impact on the diversity narrative in Hollywood, she took the job and here we are now. 

A U.S. native, Boz moved to Ghana at 6 months old only to return to States five years later because of the political instability in Ghana at the time. Her father, a politician, escaped with Boz, her mother, two younger sisters, and the unborn kid in Boz’s mother’s belly. 

After a few years in the states, her parents wanted to go back to Africa but couldn’t go back to Ghana because of the political turmoil so they went to Nairobi in Kenya. But alas, politics called for Boz’s father to go back to Ghana so they went and lived there for another 2.5 years. Then, he called it quits - politics was not going to work out so they moved back to Colorado when Boz was 12 years old. 

Her wildly interesting life just continues to unfold. 

She has so far been recognized as Billboard’s Top Women in Music and Female Executive of the Year. In addition to being Fortune’s 2016 Top 40 Under 40, Fast Company’s 100 Most Creative People, etc. 

Bozoma St. John has a story that you want to follow - there is still so much left to see come from her capabilities.
