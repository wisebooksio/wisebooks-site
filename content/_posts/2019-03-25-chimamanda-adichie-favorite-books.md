If you haven’t heard of her before, you may still recognize her voice...remember when you couldn’t stop singing Beyonce’s “Flawless” in 2013? Yep, the wonderful voice that is featured in the beginning of the track is none other than Chimamanda and a segment of her inspiring TED talk entitled <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/chimamanda_ngozi_adichie_we_should_all_be_feminists">"We should all be feminists".</a>

Impressive enough as she is already, Chimamanda Adichie is actually better known as a Nigerian-born author who has penned award-winning books including <i>Purple Hibiscus</i>, <i>Half of a Yellow Sun</i>, and <i>Americanah</i>, which was on the list of The New York Times Top Ten Best Books of 2013. Her novels give a glimpse into her own life and identity as she explores her country’s politics & history (Half of a Yellow Sun) and coming-of-age as a Nigerian encountering race in America (Americanah).
