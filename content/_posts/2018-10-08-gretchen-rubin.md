Graduating with a undergrad and law degree at Yale, she has since strayed from her lawyer life path. After graduation, she clerked for Judge Pierre N. Leval of the U Court of Appeals, then for Justice Sandra Day O’Connor on the US Supreme Court. She has also lectured at the Yale Law School and the Yale School of Management but today, she is far from lawyer lady.

Today she is a best-selling author with books like <i>Better Than Before</i>, <i>Happier at Home</i>, <i>The Happiness Project</i>, and <i>The Four Tendencies</i> making New York Times Bestseller lists and selling over 2 million copies in 30 languages.

Not only does she write all thing happiness, she is also an avid podcaster on the topic as well with her sister Elizabeth Craft. <i>Happier</i> was named as one of the iTunes best podcasts in 2015, the Academy of Podcasters said it was the best podcast in 2016.
 
The goal of Rubin’s content in her books, podcast, blog, and speeches is that she want to help audiences develop behaviours to live happier and healthier lives. Now Rubin is the happiness lady. 

“I love giving books as gifts -- during the holiday season, and throughout the year. I constantly recommend a million books, but there is a handful of books that I find myself giving over and over, because they've had such an influence on me.”

Here are Gretchen Rubin's favorite books.
