Hey! Thanks for checking out our site.

We’re two girls who like to read and and love to learn from people who have accomplished interesting things in their lives. At the end of every book, we always find ourselves asking the questions, “What should I read next? Is this book really worth all of the time that I’m going to invest? Will I learn anything?”

We thought it’d be nice to have a central platform where people can discover and be inspired by role models as well as get recommendations of books that have helped shaped these individuals’ thoughts and perspectives. Hopefully, these are books that will help you in your journey to become wiser and the person you aspire to be.
