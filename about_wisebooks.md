If you look at the successful people we admire - CEOs, actors, athletes, doctors, politicians, artists (etc.) - many of them are voracious readers. 

Mark Zuckerberg is a huge advocate of reading, inhaling a book every two weeks in his 2015 challenge to himself. Winston Churchill won his Nobel prize in literature, not peace. Bill Gates, one of the busiest people in the world, finds the time to read a book a week. 

But despite that, the number of people who are reading is declining. 

Warren Buffett became the investor he is today because of how much he reads about the industry. In his own words, “read 500 pages… every day. That’s how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound interest. All of you can do it.”

He’s right, all of us can do it, and we should. Reading across broad topics cultivates creativity, knowledge, empathy, personal effectiveness, and overall, making us better at what we want to do, whatever that may be.

This is a central platform to find the books that have helped shape the role models we so admire.  Wisebooks is here to help you pick up your next book, to become wiser and to help you read more.
