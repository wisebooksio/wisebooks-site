Keegan-Michael Keele of the too-funny <i>Key & Peele</i> comedy show is not just wildly entertaining, but seriously important. Frequently adopting high-risk social topics into their skits such as slavery, police brutality, racial dynamics, and so much more, to make their audience laugh nervously and think a little.

"The deepest part of a scene should be from a human place first so that anyone can identify with the character's plight. I think it's effective to make everyone go, Oh, I didn't know black people could be like that!

You can make the humanness of it a touchstone, and hopefully it appeals to all people and it opens up dialogue amongst all people." - Key in <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/kelleylcarter/keegan-michael-key-is-the-comedian-we-need-right-now">Buzzfeed News</a>
