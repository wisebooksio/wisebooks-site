    "description": "Jane Austen teased readers with the idea of a 'heroine whom no one but myself will much like', but Emma is irresistible. 'Handsome, clever, and rich', Emma is also an 'imaginist', 'on fire with speculation and foresight'...",
    "full_description": "She sees the signs of romance all around her, but thinks she will never be married. Her matchmaking maps out relationships that Jane Austen ironically tweaks into a clearer perspective.

Ch√©ri is a love story between a very spoiled young man and his mistress who has 'been there, done that.' He's self-centered and vicious, and she ultimately turns out to be very noble...",
