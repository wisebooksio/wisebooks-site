Marc Andreessen is first and foremost, the hero who brought the Internet’s World Wide Web to the masses with his company, Netscape, in 1995. He is also a VC powerhouse- his firm, Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), has an astounding portfolio of Facebook, Skype, Twitter, Airbnb, and more unicorns. He was on the 2012 Forbes Midas List of Tech's Top Investors and in the same year, named in the Time 100, an annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world.

Andreessen co-founded Netscape, which became the de facto web browser in early 1995, ruling 75% of the market. With Netscape’s IPO, he was featured on the cover of Time and other publications, putting Andreessen in the public eye. When Netscape was acquired by AOL for $4.2bn, he immediately moved onto his next successful business, Opsware, which was one of the first companies to offer software as a service and to attempt cloud hosting. Opsware was acquired by Hewlett-Packard for $1.6bn in 2007.

Although Andreessen was a natural computer prodigy as a child, he wasn’t very interested in pursuing computer science as a career during his college years. At that time, he was pretty much the model slacker, doing only enough work for him to get by. "I'm a big fan of work avoidance," he revealed in a Rolling Stone interview.
