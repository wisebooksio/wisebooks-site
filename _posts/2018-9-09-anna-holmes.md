Anna Holmes is a writer and founder of Jezebel, a liberal blog geared towards women.

Holmes started off her career at traditional women’s magazines, Glamour and Instyle, but quickly grew tired of them. “Their point is to create insecurities and then solve them” said Holmes in an interview with <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/media/2013/10/anna-holmes-book-jezebel-interview/">Mother Jones</a>. In 2007, she created Jezebel under Gawker media, for women who were “interested in both fashion and how the models were treated.” “At that time, there was almost no women’s media outlet that wasn’t insulting in some way to young women,” she told Mother Jones.

She grew Jezebel to a massive media platform with 32 million monthly page views and when Mother Jones asked her where Jezebel has made the biggest impact, Holmes says, “Along with image manipulation, diversity in the pages of women’s magazines. We would count up the models of color every season, and it was always abominably low. Also I felt that if we just presented people of color, even photographs with no commentary, that would be normalizing. So I decided to put up photos between the text posts, full width—a young girl in Germany getting dressed up for an Octoberfest parade, a young mother in Namibia walking her children down a road, a teacher in Mumbai, a nurse in Tokyo. Women living their lives around the world, and the majority of the world is not white.”  

Here are the books Holmes thinks everyone should read:
