Peter Thiel is the co-founder of PayPal and Palantir, first investor in Facebook, venture capitalist at Founders Fund, and author of startup bible, Zero to One.

Thiel was incredibly bright from a young age – he was reportedly once one of the highest ranked under-21 chess players in the US. He attended Stanford where he studied philosophy, got his JD law degree and worked as a lawyer for a while. That is, until, he co-founded Paypal with the intention of making money transactions easier. Paypal was sold to eBay in 2002 for $1.5bn and he went on to launch Clarium Capital, a global macro hedge fund, as well as Palantir Technologies, he CIA-backed big data analysis company. As if the laws of time don’t apply to him, over the years Thiel has been able to co-found three VC firms (Founders Fund, Valar Ventures, and Mithril Capital), serve as a partner at Y-Combinator, create the Thiel Foundation, and publish 2 books.

Thiel has invested a lot of money into technological singularity (aka the point where AI takes over society) and finding ways to escape death. Thiel has invested millions into startups working on anti-aging medicine and believes society should be more open-minded to some pretty radical life-extension methods, like <a href="https://www.inc.com/jeff-bercovici/peter-thiel-young-blood.html">“having young people’s blood transfused into his own veins”</a> radical.

Wondering where he gets his visionary, slightly eccentric ideas from? Check out the books on his bookshelf:
