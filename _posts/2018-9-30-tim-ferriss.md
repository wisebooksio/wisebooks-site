Tim Ferriss or as they call it the human guinea pig, super interviewer, author, interviewer, speaker, an overall interesting fellow. 

He is an early-stage tech investor in some pretty nbd companies like Uber, Facebook, Shopify, Duolingo, Alibaba, Angellist, Evernote, Twitter, 9gag, etc…. It’s chill. Ferriss is also a 5X #1 New York Times and Wall Street Journal best-seller with his books (4-Hour Workweek, 4-Hour Chef, 4-Hour Body, Tools of Titans, Tribe of Mentors) and he runs a podcast with 300M+ downloads. 

<b>Some other randomly impressive skills</b>

* He speaks Japanese, Mandarin, Spanish, and German
* He was a high school-level competitive wrestler
* He learned to swim at 31 years old then competed in an open water race
* Competed at the Tango World Championships in Buenos Aires winning the Guiness World Record for the most Argentine tango spins in a minute
* Won the 75KG weight class in the 1999 United States of America Wushu Kungfu Federation national (Chinese) kickboxing championship through techniques like dramatic dehydration before the weigh-in and intense aggression in pushing competitors out of the ring

Most interesting man in the world? Most random man in the world? Whatever you want to call it, Tim Ferriss is a unique-as-heck individual. 

<b>A little bit of background</b>

He grew up in East Hampton in New York and moved onto Princeton University where he completed a degree in East Asian Studies in 2000. As a fresh grad with big eyes, the world in front of him, and a degree in East Asian Studies, he moved into sales at a data storage company. He quickly figured out how to hack his sales quota and become a top seller by calling companies at really early times in the morning so he could get straight to the decision maker. But this wasn't going to be his life. While in sales, he started his own company, BrainQUICKEN which was a protein-health-type supplement of sorts. 

<b>Higher, higher education</b>

Instead of enrolling in a formal MBA degree, he committed what tuition would have cost to a real-world MBA. A Stanford MBA would be about $120K USD for two years which is a lot of money. 

He sought out impressive individuals to learn from and put his money in some smart companies, with the intention of putting $120K into some smart companies but also considering the $120K a sunk cost. His mindset was that he’d “lose" the cash.  

He called this the “Tim Ferriss Fund” where he would make about 6-12 angel investments over the course of his “two-year MBA”. Angel investments are relatively small amounts of money that are put into early-stage startups which could be something like two engineers on a couch making a prototype to put on the internet. 

Of the 15 investments he made, none of them died and there was one exit. He doesn’t recommend this but he learned a tremendous amount and with his personality, there’s no way that he wouldn’t have taken away an experience worth an MBA.
