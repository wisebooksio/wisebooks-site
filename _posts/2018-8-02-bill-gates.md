Founder of the world’s largest software company, Bill Gates has long retired but has long been listed as the richest man in the world until some time in 2017. 

Bill grew up in a tight-knit, upper-middle class family. In his youth, he was a voracious reader but displayed withdrawn behaviours. His parents’ concern about his behaviour led them to enroll him in a private school in which his intellectual capabilities truly showed. This school was his first exposure to computers and where he met his co-founder, Paul Allen.

The pair had split for a few years to pursue their university degrees, before dropping out to pursue Microsoft. They created the Microsoft operating systems for new computers, and their big break came when IBM approached the two to create an OS for their PCs. This established them as the dominant software manufacturer in the industry. Microsoft has since become the industry standard. 

In 2000, he stepped down as the operating CEO, after he had come to a decision to devote his focus to the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation. The charity’s initiatives revolve around international and domestic issues in health and education. Throughout the years, they have donated tens of billions to the foundation. 

Earlier in 2018, Gates announced the partnership with Larry Page, founder of Google, in providing a universal flu vaccine and $12M in funding. However, he still has cash to spare and is directing it outside of the Gates foundation to other organizations such as the $50M donation to the Dementia Discovery Fund to find a cure for Alzheimer's. Around the same time, Bill and Melinda donated $80 million to the smart city development in Phoenix, Arizona. 

Although his wealth came from Microsoft, it seems as though Bill wants his legacy to be the work that he and his wife achieve with their charitable foundation.
