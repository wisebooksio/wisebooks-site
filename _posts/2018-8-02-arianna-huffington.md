Arianna Huffington, the author, journalist, and businesswoman founded the Huffington Post, abbreviated as Huffpost, sometimes Huffpo. The Huffpost is a liberal American news and opinion site that reaches millions of audiences around the globe covering a range of topics from health, politics, culture, and more. It was originally meant to be an outlet for liberal commentary and still follows such a stance in its content. In 2011, AOL acquired the company for $315 million USD and made Arianna the editor-in-chief. 

In 2012, it was the most popular political site in the world based on Alexa’s Global Traffic Rank, and data collected by Compete and Quantcast. 

Ariana was born in beautiful Athens, Greece before continuing her education in economics at the University of Cambridge, and her life in the United States. Over the course of her life she’s written twelve books, ran for the California Governor position and failed, and started a new company with a focus on mental health and wellness, called Thrive Global.
