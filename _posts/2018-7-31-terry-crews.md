“In order to ‘have’ you must ‘do,’ and in order to ‘do’ you must ‘be’.”

Crews is a former NFL defenseman, actor in films and television shows like White Chicks and Brooklyn 99, author, father, grandfather, artist, and furniture designer. 

In 2014, he released his book, <i>Manhood: How To Be a Better Man - Or Just Live with One</i>. He details his childhood in which he grew up in a strict Christian family with an alcoholic father, how he pulls himself out of his home environment through a football scholarship. Throughout his time at Western Michigan University, he found painting portraits of other guys on the team as a means of earning some extra cash and sometimes up to $5K a painting. After his stint at college, he played professionally in the NFL for some time as a glorified tackling defenseman before leaving after 5 years to Los Angeles to pursue a career in acting. However, the NFL point on his resume did not automatically translate into instantaneous fame in Hollywood. Crews spent the year being broke before catching a break in some movies, commercials, and television shows, launching what was the beginning of an incredible acting career. 

In his book, Crews also details the porn addiction that began at the age of 12 and later, almost destroys his marriage with his wife. After seeking help and several session of therapy, he and his wife have since reunited. The two of them have been together since 1990 and Terry continues to talk about the issue to this day, encouraging others to seek help and opening up the discussion on the topic of sex addiction. 

To add onto a growing list of credentials, Crews is high-end fashion designer. His previous projects attracted the attention of creative director, Jerry Healing of the influential furniture makers, Bernhardt Design. Healing reached out to Crews to design a line of furniture for Bernhardt, and launched his debut collection early in 2017.

Crews has come a long way from his home in Flint Michigan.
