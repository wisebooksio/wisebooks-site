Oprah Winfrey was born in a small town before she started her career in media and earning her spot as the most watched daytime show host on TV. Her style of interviewing, personality, and ability to open up her guests in front of audiences of millions merited her success. 

However, she is not just a TV personality. With the deterioration of daytime television, Oprah has sworn to set aside the antics and the tabloid stories that increase viewership numbers. The media power woman also ventured out into other mediums, like Oprah’s Book Club, O Magazine, and eventually her OWN (Oprah Winfrey Network, pun intended) network. 

Reading has always been a large part of her life. In her childhood, and under her strict grandmother, she began reading at 2.5 years old. When she turned six, she was sent to live with her mother in a dangerous, and poor Milwaukee ghetto. 

Oprah was frequently left alone when her mother had to work, and repeatedly sexually assaulted by men her family trusted. She was sent to her father, back to her mother, and eventually settled with her father who she claims to have saved her life. 

He provided guidance, structure, safety, and books. She was required to complete weekly book reports, had to learn a minimum of five new vocabulary words per day, and shone, brightly, in school. As a result, you can only imagine how long the list of important books of her life can get.
