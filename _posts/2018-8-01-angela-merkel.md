Angela Merkel is a powerhouse in Germany, often called the world’s most powerful woman, the de facto leader of the European Union, and the leader of the Free World. Merkel is a German politician that has been serving as the country’s chancellor since 2005, leading the Christian Democratic Union since 2000, and navigating the complex political landscape we see today. 

She achieved her doctorate in quantum chemistry in 1986, and worked as a research scientist before beginning a career in politics in the wake of the 1989 revolutions in Germany. Following the reunification of Eastern and Western Germany in 1990, she joined the Christian Democratic Union and was soon appointed as the Federal Minister of women and youth, then later serving as the minister for the environmental and nuclear safety, under the Helmut Kohl government. 

When Kohl lost the general elections of 1998, Merkel was named the secretary-general of the CDU and was chosen as the party’s leader 2 years later, only to lose the candidacy to Edmund Stoiber in 2002. However, in the 2005 elections, she had narrowly defeated the opposition becoming the first former citizen of the German Democratic Republic to lead a reunited Germany, and the first woman to lead Germany since it became a modern nation state in 1871. She is currently in her fourth term as chancellor. 

In her time, she has overseen the struggle of the European economy, the Ukraine crisis, Europe’s greatest refugee crisis since WWII, and more. The main theme of her government has thoroughly been pragmatism, demonstrating her open-mindedness, and to avoid position-taking for the sake of an ideology. She also speaks Russian, German, and English.
