Ed Cooke is a Grandmaster of Memory. Yes, it’s a thing and it’s a big thing. 

This title is awarded to people who can complete the following three tasks: 

* Memorize 1,000 random digits in an hour
* Memorize the order of 10 decks of cards (of 52 cards each) in an hour
* Memorize the order of one deck of cards (of 52 cards) in under two minutes

Try doing any of the above in a month…

From 2003-2008, he placed in a memory championship every year. Here’s the repertoire: 10th in the World Memory Championships in 2003, 11th in 2004, 11th in 2005, 8th in 2006, 7th in 2007, and finally 8th in 2008. Also 2007 Champion at the Cambridge Memory Championship, and 3rd in 2004. 

He’s really dove deep into the memory category co-founding Memrise in 2005, the education app that optimizes spaced repetition technologies to help its users learn things like languages or chemistry. It has over 20M registered users and has been profitable since 2016. 

He’s also the author of <i>Remember, Remember: Learn the Stuff You Thought You Never Could</i>. 

Cooke is pretty geeky in such a niche category: memorization. He graduated with a degree in psychology and philosophy from Oxford University in 2004 and completed a Master’s Degree in Cognitive Science at Paris Descartes University where he began his life of memorization. He studied, learned, and taught memory techniques.
