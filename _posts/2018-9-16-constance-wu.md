If you have seen daylight in the last month or so, then you know that everyone and their mother has watched <i>Crazy Rich Asians</i>, starring the phenomenal and inspiring, Constance Wu. 

She was born to parents who emigrated from Taiwan and grew up in Richmond, Virginia. After school, she moved to New York and scraped money together working as a theatre actress and waitress for 10 years; that is pure grit and love for acting. 

With big acting dreams, Wu got her big break after landing a major role in Eddie Huang’s <i>Fresh off the Boat</i> TV series that tells the story of the Asian American family and it’s entering its FIFTH season. Oh BTW, it was the first network TV show in 20+ years to centre an Asian family (seriously network TV?), so it’s a pretty big deal. The show and Constance’s role is a big win for Asian Americans but you know what’s an even bigger deal? That she starred in <i>Crazy Rich Asians</i>. Yes, the romcom that topped box offices, making $20 mil+ on the opening weekend AND then another $20 mil+ the weekend following which is insane. 

That kind of audience hold is almost unheard of. Okay back to the real stuff, this is the first Hollywood film to star an ALL-Asian cast and Asian lead since 1993’s <i>Joy Luck Club</i>. Yes, that’s right, 25+ years… Hollywood, are you for real right now? You’ve been depriving us. 

Constance Wu is a huge advocate of the Asian-American and female voice in Hollywood. Aside from her pursuance of such roles, she has spoken about the act of yellowface in Hollywood, in which directors star famous white actors in Asian roles only to alter their face with “Asian features.” When she received backlash for her position, she mic-dropped this quote: <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/susancheng/constance-wu-mingna-wen-urge-asian-americans-to-fight-back#.exX50Px4V">“The whitewashing will just continue and continue if [white filmmakers] become comfortable.”</a> 

And with that, we’ll leave you with one last word of inspiration from Wu, <a href="https://twitter.com/ConstanceWu/status/1024449682766852096">“I hope Asian American kids watch Crazy Rich Asians and realize they can be the heroes of their own stories.”</a>
