Ayaan Hirsi Ali is a controversial Somali-born American women’s rights activist, best-selling author, and former politician. She was born in Somalia in 1969 and was a devout Muslim in her youth but questioned the authority that limited women’s rights around her; today she is a devout atheist. As a young girl, she was subjected to Female Genital Mutilation (FGM). When she was told by her father that she was to marry a distant cousin, she fled the country to claim asylum in Holland. 

Once she arrived, she started working as a janitor but rose time and time again, eventually earning her position in Dutch parliament. She has since stepped down due to scandal surrounding her asylum application when she arrived in the country. 

Ali founded the AHA Foundation that advocates against honour killings, child marriage, FGM, and women’s rights for girls in the United States. Her activism has achieved awards in free speech and moral courage form the Swedish Liberal Party and the Danish newspaper Jynllands-Posten. She was also listed as one of Time’s 100 Most Influential People in the world in 2005. 

The controversy surrounds her outspoken criticism of Islam with critics claiming her career is built on belittling Muslims and Islam.
