Elon Reeve Musk: businessman, investor, engineer, father. Everyone and their mother knows Musk, all with varying opinions. 

Regardless, he was born in Pretoria, South Africa. Musk was an avid reader with a difficult childhood. At 12 years old, he discovered his interest in computers and at 17 years he moved to Canada where he enrolled in Queen’s University where he met the mother of his triplets. He left after two years to complete a degree in economics at the Wharton School of Business and physics from the College of Arts and Sciences. Soon after, he began his PhD in applied physics and material sciences only to drop out after two days because of his fear of missing out. He wanted to ride the wave of the dot com bubble, and successfully did so, founding his first software company, Zip2 before selling it to Compaq for $340M in 1999. 

Soon after, came X.com, the mobile payments company that merged with Peter Thiel’s Cofinity to become Paypal. The company was bought for $1.5B by eBay.

Musk used the money from his ventures to invest in the space industry, creating the company we know today as SpaceX with the goal of disrupt the space transportation industry, putting people on Mars. As of December 2017, the company was valued at $20 billion. He’s also co-founded Tesla, acts as the chairman of SolarCity, co-founder of OpenAI, Neuralink, and the Boring Company. 

Tesla is the sexy electric car company that you might see on the streets of your city. SolarCity manufactures solar panels for homes to look like shingles that one would normally use. OpenAI is a not-for-profit research company that aims to promote responsible development of artificial intelligence. Neuralink focuses on the development of brain-computer interfaces. The Boring Company aims to improve transportation through underground tunnel and infrastructure development. 

Musk wants to change our world and the way we live. At the same time, he’s worth approximately $20 billion.
