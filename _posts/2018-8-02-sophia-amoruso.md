An American businesswoman, Sophia Amoruso began her entrepreneurial journey at 22 years old with the brand Nasty Girl Vintage on eBay. The success of Nasty Girl’s eBay store led to its expansion into fashion retail. Her company made large strides and in six years made it onto Inc Magazine’s list of fastest growing companies in 2012 and reached $300 million in sales in 2016. She has been featured on many power lists such as Forbe’s list of America’s Richest Self-Made Women, and even made it to onto Vanity Fair’s list of best dressed. 

The brand unfortunately filed for bankruptcy 4 years later which destroyed her fortune. It caused a mental toll, financial toll, and just a year before the bankruptcy, she had filed for divorce adding onto the emotional stress. It was a reset on her life - she had nothing and began again. She moved on. 

Amoruso started her new brand #Girlboss which transformed into a New York Times bestselling book, a media company that focuses on redefining success for women, and a Netflix comedy series. She has made many decisions, some of which were hard mistakes, but which have laid the foundation for her present-day success.
