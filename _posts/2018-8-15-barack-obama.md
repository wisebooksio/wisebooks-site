Obama served as the first African-American president of the United States from January 20, 2009 to January 20, 2017. Born to an American mother and a Kenyan father in Honolulu, Hawaii, Obama started off with humble beginnings. He was part of a middle-class family, made his way into Harvard, worked as a lawyer, a governor, and eventually, as the president of the United States. 

During his administration, he helped pass several bills that sought to rebuild the economy, ensured health care for everyone, ended the war in Iraq, brought forward marriage equality, and much more. 

Obama’s primary legislation was in health care reform, the Protection and Affordable Care Act which sought to prevent denial of coverage based on pre-existing conditions, allowed for the parental coverage of people under 26 years old, provided free health screenings for certain individuals, and in 2012, passed a law that made it mandatory for every American to purchase health insurance. 

His actions in foreign policy, the economy, and efforts in pushing stricter gun control laws have made people look back at his presidency with nostalgia. Among other things, he was known for his calm demeanor, his charismatic personality, and hope for the future; frequently speaking about the change that he and the American people would bring to the country and the world. 

On another note, Obama reads hundreds and hundreds of books. This list is based on Wired’s 2016 interview that pinned down his <b>essential</b> reads.
