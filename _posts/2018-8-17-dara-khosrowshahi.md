Dara Khosrowshahi is Uber’s current CEO. He is an Iranian-American businessman who has formerly served as the CEO of Expedia group (notably one of the highest rated CEOs on Glassdoor), a member of the board of directors for BET.com, Hotels.com, and the New York Times Company. 

The method of most companies is to fail quickly, fail often, and iterate. However, under Kalanick’s leadership, Uber was failing too much, too quickly, and absolutely everywhere in its culture, products, and brand. The company grew preposterously under Kalanick. 

Khosrowshahi has been more deliberate in his leadership, putting forward good products and safe services before anything else; which might be exactly what Uber needs. 

In his own words: 
> “We were probably trading off doing the right thing for growth, and thinking about competition maybe a bit too aggressively, and some of those things were mistakes. Mistakes themselves are not a bad thing, the question is, do you learn from those mistakes? 2017 has been a really tough year, but this is going to result in us being a better company.” - Dara Khosrowshahi as quoted in the New Yorker, 2018

Khosrowshahi’s story is an interesting one. He was born in Iran into a wealthy Muslim family in 1969. His family founded the Alborz Investment Company; a conglomerate involved in a variety of industries such as pharmaceuticals, packaging, trading, etc. However, in 1978, his family’s wealth became the target of the Iranian government so his mother made the decision: they were going to leave everything and flee Iran. One year later, the country faced the Iranian Revolution.

This is a large part of why Khosrowshahi is such a critic of the Trump administration’s immigration policy. 

His family first fled to the South of France before settling in New York, USA. Khosrowshahi later completed his Bachelor’s degree in engineering at Brown and began his career in investment banking before following the trail that led him to where his is today. 

We asked Dara Khosrowshahi, "What are a few of the books that have been really important in shaping you over the years?" And this is what he told us:
