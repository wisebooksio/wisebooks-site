Aoki is a two-time Grammy nominated DJ and producer, founder of Dim Mak Records, founder of Steve Aoki Charitable Fund, and designer of the contemporary menswear line Dim Mak Collection. He is the third child of Rocky Aoki, the former wrestler, adrenaline-junkie, and founder of the restaurant chain, Benihana. 

His larger-than-life dad frowned upon Steve’s early work in music and discouraged it, never providing support financially or emotionally, other than providing Steve a place to cut onions in the restaurant and earn minimum wage. Father Aoki divorced Steve’s Mom in 1981, moving on to marry two other women and having a total of seven children. He died in 2008, before seeing his son’s rise to stardom.

Steve has grown up in the shadow of his father, from whom he has inherited his addiction to adrenaline and wildness. But his heart, and all of his compassion come from his mother.
