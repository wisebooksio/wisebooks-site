Melinda Gates is known as the most powerful woman in philanthropy, co-chairing the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in another industry that is largely dominated by men. With only <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinehoward/2017/11/01/most-powerful-women-in-philanthropy-and-nonprofits-2017/#796d723d45a9">33% of leaders of charitable funds worth $10 billion or more are led by women,</a> Melinda Gates continues to lead by example chairing the foundation for over 15 years. 

She and her husband agreed to donate 80% of their multi-billion dollar fortune to the foundation that focuses on improving health care, reducing poverty, and growing educational opportunities around the globe. Today, the endowment is well over $50 billion, with about half of that fund coming from Bill and Melindaâ€™s donations. 

She has also quietly entered the venture capital space focussing on investing in female and/or minority focussed venture firms because she, like many of us, are frustrated at the diversity numbers in venture-backed startups. An astounding 3% of VC money goes to female founders with an embarrassing 0.2% going to women of colour. This includes <a href="http://fortune.com/2018/01/23/diversity-aspect-ventures-melinda-gates/">Aspect Ventures</a>, <a href="https://femalefoundersfund.com/">Female Founders</a>, and <a href="https://defy.vc/">Defy partners</a> according to Fortune. Melinda Gates is a champion in this field and has put hundreds of millions where her mouth is.
